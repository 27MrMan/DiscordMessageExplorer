# Discord Message Explorer

This program is to find and display statistics from discord messages
For example, from servers or group DMs.

Project currently just started. Very much incomplete.

# Status

Currently working on more plots, for example "Most Messages" or "Message per Messages"
First working version of the program is complete :D Now, in the program you can do the following:

# How to use

- Download the python file and assets folder, and keep those two and the csv file in the same direcotry.
- Download the requrired packages, and then somehow acquire a .csv file with all the discord messages of a group DM, etc.
- Then, rename that file to 'messages.csv'
- Run the program, and in the 'Words' tab, you can enter any word, and it will display a chart with the statics of how much each user uses that word.
- If a user isnt on that graph, it means they did not use that word.
